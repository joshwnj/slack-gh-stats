# Slack Github Integration

Premise: it's nice to see updates from github in a slack channel, because it gives some sense of progress. But when there is a lot of activity it becomes way too noisy.

Goal: give periodical summaries of activity happening on github (issues, comments, etc) without taking over the channel.
